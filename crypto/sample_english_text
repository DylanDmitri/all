My name is Jacob Warner, and most nights I dream of miniature monkeys. If I owned a miniature monkey, I would name him Maltheo. For all hours of the day, his purpose would be to sit on my shoulder and give me a small fist bump whenever I made a joke – even if it were god awful and caused tears instead of laughter. The day my miniature monkey companion becomes reality, I can die happy.
Although, when I die, I’m not sure where I’ll be going. My mom, being a red-headed she-devil, always told me that she took my soul at birth. I guess she was hungry or had never tasted baby soul before? I don’t know.
On a happier note, I absolutely frickin’ love dogs. Although they all succumb to Stockholm syndrome, they couldn’t be happier! If all humans could live life like dogs, full of joy and wonder, the world would be much more peaceful. I can only hope… Maybe Trump will bring that peace? Oh, who am I kidding.
